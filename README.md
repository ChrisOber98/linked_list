Linked List Project in C

Description

This project implements a singly linked list in C. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The linked list can dynamically grow or shrink in size, making it an ideal data structure for situations where the number of elements is unknown or changes frequently.

Features
Node Structure: Each node stores an integer value and a pointer to the next node.
Basic Operations:
Insert a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
Delete a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Search for a node by value.
Display the entire linked list.
Reverse the linked list.
Length function to find the number of nodes in the list.
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/linked_list.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd linked_list
Compile the project:
gcc -o linked_list linked_list.c
Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

./linked_list

The program will display the linked list operations available and allow you to perform actions such as inserting, deleting, searching, displaying, and reversing nodes.
